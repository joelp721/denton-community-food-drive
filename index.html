        <h3>
            Our Purpose
        </h3>
        <p>One of the biggest problems our town faces is food insecurity. The goal of this food drive is to help alleviate the anguish many face of not knowing where there next meal will come from. With the help of people like you we can make sure those who are homeless or can't afford healthy foods for whatever reason are able to have a hot meal just like the rest of us.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>
            Here Are The Facts...
        </h3>
            <p>
                According to a <a href="https://www.servedenton.org/articles/the-impact-of-covid-19-on-food-insecurity-in-denton-county-and-how-denton-community-food-center-is-securing-the-gap" target="_blank">Serve Denton Survey</a> around <strong>1 in 5</strong> Denton County residents experience food insecurity. This is an unsettling number but we believe it can be reduced through our teams efforts and community engagement. 
            </p>
            <br>

        <h3>How You Can Help</h3>
            <p>This is going to be a <em>team</em> effort, and there's no better group of people to address the needs of our community than the ones that live here. We understand that hunger is a multi faceted problem and needs an effective action plan in order to be solved. With the help of some of our foudning members we've developed a list of steps that can be taken to make our efforts much more feasible.</p>

        <h2>
            Action Plan
        </h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Spread The Word</strong> - While our small team can do what they can via Social Media or newspaper advertisements, these resources can be time consuming for us to dedicate ourselves to using and costly as well. That's why it's so important that you spread the word of our cause to family and friends alike. </li>

            <br>

            <li><strong>Weekly Meetings</strong> - We understand many of us live busy lives which is why we plan on scheduling meetings every <em>Saturday</em> @<strong>5pm</strong>. If this is not a convenient time, we have a <a href="survey-form.html">survey</a> that you can fill out with your ideal meeting time and general information regarding our food drive. This is optional but feel free to fill it out as it will give us valuable insight in making our efforts worthwhile. Feel free to bring in supplies at these meetings as well.</li>
            
            <br>

            <li><strong>Sourcing Food</strong> - This is arguably the most essential part of this action plan. Since longevity of foods is a major factor to consider, we request that you bring in healthy canned foods and other items with extended shelf lives. While any effort to help stop hunger in our community is appreciated, processed foods such as breakfast cereals, junk food, and other items can't be accepted.</li>
